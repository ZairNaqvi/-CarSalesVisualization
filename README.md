# Part 1: Data Preparation and Visualization Using Excel

In Part 1, I took the Excel file provided and performed data preparation tasks to ensure the data was clean and structured for analysis. This involved cleaning the data, adjusting formatting, and organizing it into pivot tables.

I created different pivot tables to showcase various key performance indicators (KPIs) such as quantity sold by dealer ID, profit by date and model, profit by year and dealer ID, and profit of Hudson model cars by dealer ID. These visualizations provide insights into sales performance, profit margins, and dealer-specific metrics. By organizing the data in this manner, stakeholders can easily interpret and analyze the information to make informed decisions.

# Part 2: Real-time Visualization Using Cognos Analytics

In Part 2, I leveraged Cognos Analytics to create dynamic visualizations that provide real-time insights into the dealership's operations. These visualizations are updated automatically as new data becomes available, ensuring that stakeholders have access to the most current information.

For example, on the Sales dashboard, I created visualizations to display key metrics such as profit, quantity sold, and quantity sold by model. These visualizations are presented in a user-friendly format, allowing stakeholders to quickly assess performance and identify trends.

Additionally, on the Service dashboard, I created visualizations to track metrics such as recalls per model of car and customer sentiment. These visualizations help stakeholders monitor customer satisfaction and identify any issues that may arise.

Overall, by utilizing Cognos Analytics, I created powerful visualizations that enable stakeholders to make data-driven decisions in real-time, ensuring the dealership remains agile and responsive to changing market conditions.
